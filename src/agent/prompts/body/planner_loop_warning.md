CRITICAL WARNING: You are looping Planner->Verifier without making any new file changes. 
The previous verification failed, and you have NOT modified any code since then. 
Running the same tests on the same code will result in the same failure.
STOP LOOPING.
1. If you need to fix the code, go to 'coder'.
2. If you are stuck, go to 'snitch'.
3. Do NOT go to 'verifier' again.
