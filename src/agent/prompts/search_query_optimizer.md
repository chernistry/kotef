Task: Rewrite a user goal into a concise English web search query for software engineering best practices.

Rules (very important):
- Output: ONE line with ONLY the optimized search query (no JSON, no labels, no explanations).
- 8–16 words; prefer lowercase; use spaces and hyphens only (no other punctuation, no quotes).
- Translate the goal to English if needed, but keep library/framework/tool names as-is (e.g. tkinter, flet, react, typescript, langgraph).
- Preserve core intent and all important constraints (language, framework, platform, UI/CLI/API type, "modern"/"2025" best practices, animation, sound, macOS, etc.).
- Focus on finding up-to-date best practices, patterns, examples, and official docs for implementing the requested functionality.
- Do not invent technologies or constraints that are not present in the input.

Context:
- Goal: {goal}
- Tech stack: {techStack}
- Domain: {domain}
- Project description (may be truncated): {projectDescription}

Output: one line, optimized search query only.
