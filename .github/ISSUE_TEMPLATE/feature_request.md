### What problem are you trying to solve?

Describe the underlying problem or pain point, not just the feature idea.

### Proposed solution

What would you like kotef to do differently?

- New behaviour / command / flag?
- New node / tool / prompt?
- Better integration with SDD (`.sdd/*`)?

Feel free to reference similar behaviour in other agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, etc.).

### How would this fit the project?

If you can, relate this to the project’s goals:

- safer edits,
- better error‑first debugging,
- fewer loops / wasted tool calls,
- better eval / observability.

### Alternatives you’ve considered

Any existing workarounds, or other approaches you thought about.

### Additional context

Links, logs, tickets, or anything else that helps understand the request.
