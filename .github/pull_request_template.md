## Summary

What does this PR change, in 1–3 sentences?

## Type of change

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Refactor / cleanup
- [ ] Docs only
- [ ] Other (describe)

## How it fits kotef’s “brain + body” model

- Does this change:
  - the **brain** (SDD files, prompts, planner/researcher/verifier logic), or
  - the **body** (tools, fs, test runner, CLI), or both?
- If you touched `.sdd/*`, `src/agent/prompts/*`, or `src/agent/nodes/*`, briefly explain how behaviour changes.

## Implementation details

- Key files touched:
  - `path/to/file1`
  - `path/to/file2`
- Any important design decisions or trade‑offs worth calling out?

## Tests

- [ ] `npm test` (or relevant subset) was run
- [ ] New tests were added or existing tests updated

Details:

```text
<commands and high‑level results>
```

If you didn’t run tests, explain why.

## SDD / docs

- [ ] SDD updated if necessary (`.sdd/project.md`, `.sdd/architect.md`, `.sdd/best_practices.md`, tickets)
- [ ] Docs updated if necessary (`README.md`, `docs/KB.md`, etc.)

If not, why is it safe to leave them as‑is?

## Additional context

Anything else reviewers should know (linked issues/tickets, screenshots, run logs, etc.).
