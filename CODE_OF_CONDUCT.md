# Code of Conduct

kotef is built by and for people who care about real, production‑grade agents. We want the project to be welcoming, direct, and safe to collaborate in.

This is a lightweight Code of Conduct modeled on the spirit of the Contributor Covenant, but tuned for a small, engineering‑heavy project.

## Our pledge

We as maintainers and contributors pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are opinionated about code and architecture, not about people.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and honest in discussions.
- Focusing on technical arguments and evidence, not personalities.
- Giving constructive feedback; explaining *why* something is a problem and how it could be improved.
- Acknowledging mistakes quickly and fixing them.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks.
- Trolling, deliberate derailment of discussions, or sustained negativity.
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing) without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- edit, remove, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct;
- temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- the repository and its issue / PR trackers,
- any official project chat channels (if created),
- and any public spaces where someone is representing the project.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, you can:

- open a confidential issue, or
- contact the maintainer directly via GitHub (profile email or DM if available).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated in good faith. The maintainers will decide what action is appropriate, which may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) but shortened and adapted for this project.
